You can download the datasets from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hyena222/new-test-data and https://www.kaggle.com/hyena222/new-train-data and https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013. You can get the csv version of the Kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013 The one called "fer2013" is the data set from FER2013 on Kaggle. Another two called new-test-data and new-train-data contain the data set generated using face detection on FER2013.

orb-cnn/face-detection.ipynb contains code for ORB-CNN model and face detection. cnn-svm-rf-xgboost.ipynb contains code for the CNN-SVM model, CNN-RF model and CNN-XGBoost classifier. To train the models, the .ipynb can be run directly after downloading the datasets.
